No ref for Moravcsik, (2019).
Assumed to be Transparency in Qualitative Research

We don't allow an "introduction" heading, it's implied. Also, we do not use a 4th level heading, usually only 3 levels are needed. I therefore raised "Common Concerns..." and "Rigorous Transparency" to first level, and all headings under them one up as well, as that okay?

A few year references were off by one year, can't remember which ones.
