  abstract = {Objective               Fibromyalgia (FM) comprises many symptoms and features. Consequently, studies on the condition have used a wide variety of outcome measures and assessment instruments. We investigated those outcome measures and instruments in association with the OMERACT (Outcome measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials) FM Workshop initiative to define core outcome measures that should be used to assess FM.                                         Methods               A systematic literature review up to December 2007 was carried out using the keywords “fibromyalgia,” “treatment” or “management,” and “trial.” Data were extracted on outcome measures and assessment instruments used and the pre and post mean and standard deviation to calculate effect sizes (ES). Further sensitivity analysis was carried out according to treatment type, blinding status, and study outcome.                                         Results               The outcome domains identified fell largely within those defined by OMERACT. Morning stiffness was frequently assessed and therefore has been included here. The number of assessment instruments used was wide-ranging, so sensitivity analysis was only carried out on the top 5 within each domain. ES ranged from 0.54 to 3.77 for the key OMERACT domains. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was the only exception that had no instrument with moderate sensitivity. Of the secondary domains, dyscognition was lacking any sensitive instrument, as were fatigue and anxiety in pharmacological trials.                                         Conclusion               Each of the key OMERACT domains has an instrument that appears to be sensitive to change, with the exception of HRQOL, which requires further research. Dyscognition, fatigue, and anxiety would all benefit from more research into their assessment instruments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity. METHODS: A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use. RESULTS: A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89\%) and specificity (82\%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale. CONCLUSION: The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.},

Demand for instruments to monitor mental well-being at a population level and evaluate mental health promotion initiatives is growing. This article describes the development and validation of a new scale, comprised only of positively worded items relating to different aspects of positive mental health: the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS).                                         Methods               WEMWBS was developed by an expert panel drawing on current academic literature, qualitative research with focus groups, and psychometric testing of an existing scale. It was validated on a student and representative population sample. Content validity was assessed by reviewing the frequency of complete responses and the distribution of responses to each item. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the scale measured a single construct. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Criterion validity was explored in terms of correlations between WEMWBS and other scales and by testing whether the scale discriminated between population groups in line with pre-specified hypotheses. Test-retest reliability was assessed at one week using intra-class correlation coefficients. Susceptibility to bias was measured using the Balanced Inventory of Desired Responding.                                         Results               WEMWBS showed good content validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the single factor hypothesis. A Cronbach's alpha score of 0.89 (student sample) and 0.91 (population sample) suggests some item redundancy in the scale. WEMWBS showed high correlations with other mental health and well-being scales and lower correlations with scales measuring overall health. Its distribution was near normal and the scale did not show ceiling effects in a population sample. It discriminated between population groups in a way that is largely consistent with the results of other population surveys. Test-retest reliability at one week was high (0.83). Social desirability bias was lower or similar to that of other comparable scales.                                         Conclusion               WEMWBS is a measure of mental well-being focusing entirely on positive aspects of mental health. As a short and psychometrically robust scale, with no ceiling effects in a population sample, it offers promise as a tool for monitoring mental well-being at a population level. Whilst WEMWBS should appeal to those evaluating mental health promotion initiatives, it is important that the scale's sensitivity to change is established before it is recommended in this context.},
