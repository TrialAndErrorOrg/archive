This article contributes to the debate about priming stud-ies by carefully examining and dissecting one priming study inparticular, namely the 2020 article "Alcohol Cues and their Effects on Sexually Aggressive Thoughts" by Julie Leboeuf, Stine Linden-Andersen, andJonathan Carriere. By pointing out the flaws of this supposedreproduction study, I reflect on the various levels of complexitythat are involved in conducting priming experiments with humansubjects. I conclude that the call for more reproductions or repli-cations is worthwhile, but only if the original experiments aresolid and theoretically interesting.},
